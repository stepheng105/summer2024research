This project was done in collaboration with Adam Manzke, and was advised by Dr. Ryan Tully-Doyle with help and inspiration from Dr. James Pascoe.

Much of this code was inspired by [this source](https://github.com/tthustla/efficient_frontier/blob/master/Efficient%20_Frontier_implementation.ipynb). For a full walkthrough of the math and concepts, please read through the tutorial.ipynb file. It has an explanation of all the math that is going on behind the scenes.
